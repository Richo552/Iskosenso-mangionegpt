## Project Description 📚
Iskosenso is a mobile app designed to empower Filipino students to achieve their educational aspirations by simplifying the scholarship search and application process. We believe that financial constraints should never hinder a student's pursuit of knowledge, and we are committed to making educational opportunities accessible to all.

The app provides a comprehensive **calendar of important dates**, including scholarship application windows, examination days, and document submission deadlines. It also clearly **lists all required documents**, categorized as common, requested, and personal, to help students stay organized.  Furthermore, applicants can easily **track the status of their scholarship applications** and manage their profile information, including demographic details and academic standing, all within a user-friendly interface.

**Iskosenso** empowers students to find and apply for scholarships by addressing their pain points in the application process, streamlining document gathering and scheduling for convenience, and connecting them with valuable information and opportunities.
